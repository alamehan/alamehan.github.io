                </ul>
                <h4 class="mtitle">User experience design (UXD)</h4>
                <p>The phrase "User experience" was first coined in the 1990s by cognitive psychologist, Don Norman. The
                  principles of UX actually stretch back thousands of years, all the way to ancient China, where the practice of
                  Feng Shui began. Practitioners believe that the arrangement of a physical space, like how furniture is
                  positioned in a room, could bring someone luck or improve their health and happiness. Today, lots of different
                  industries still rely on these same basic ideas. In tech world, UX mostly focuses on how people use or interact
                  with products. A product is a good, service, or feature. It might be a physical product (video game controller,
                  bag of photato chips, etc) or a technology product (app, website, smarthwatch, etc).
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>UX is all about how a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product.</li>
                  <li>UX designers focus on the experience that users have while using products like websites, apps, and physical
                    objects.</li>
                  <li>UX designers make those everyday interactions useful, enjoyable, and accessible.</li>
                  <li>UX designers help make technology easier to understand and more enjoyable to use.</li>
                  <li>UX designers have a good sense for visuals, but you don't need to know anything about graphic design or
                    draw.</li>
                  <li>UX designers tend to be curious about people and like thinking about how people's mind work.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>UX designer is important for consumers and businesses. Why? When people like a product, they use that product a
                  lot, and they recommended it to their friends. And more people using the product means better bussiness for the
                  company. Plus, when users have a good experience with the product, they're more likely to have a positive
                  opinion ot the company that made it. A win-win for the user and the business. Can you think of a product you
                  loved so much that you shared it with a friend? If you did, that's a gret example of UX design in action. That's
                  why organizations of all kinds, in varied industries, need to hire UX designers. Because UX designer can play in
                  improving the business.</p>
                <p>Graphic designers create visuals that tell a story or message. Graphic designers focus on the physical
                  appearance of a product, like an invitation or a poster. UX designers focus on how users interact with a
                  product.</p>

                <p>Virtual reality involves a wearable headset that takes over a user’s vision; it blocks out their physical
                  surroundings and immerses them in a completely virtual world. For example, VR can feel like you're entering the
                  setting of a magical imaginary land.</p>
                <p>Augmented reality uses the physical world as a backdrop and adds virtual elements on top of it. Users are still
                  contextually aware of their surroundings, but their reality is augmented, or enhanced, by adding elements
                  through a screen. For example, you can sit in your actual kitchen, and an AR experience can add digital images,
                  like a new barstool or a piece of artwork, to the room around you.</p>
                <p>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) designers create products that provide users with immersive
                  experiences, unbounded by the limits of the physical world. To ensure users are comfortable immersing in a VR or

                  exact names of each stage might be a little different, but the overall process is generally the same. As a
                  product moves through the development life cycle, the team might need to spend longer working in one stage than
                  in others, or repeat certain stages based on feedback. The success of each stage depends on the previous stage’s
                  completion, so it’s important to do them in order.</p>

                  the audience they're designing for, and identifies needs or challenges the audience may have. Research plays a
                  key role in this stage, because you're exploring different ways to get to know the audience you're designing
                  for. UX researchers and writes are often heavily involved in this stage, where the team might conduct interviews

                <p>When the team starts thinking of an idea for a product. Your team might already know the user problem that
                  you want to solve when you begin the product development life cycle. If not, coming up with a list of user
                  problems is a great place to start. It’s important to pay attention to the diversity of your team at this stage.
                  Teams that have meaningful diversity across identifiers like race, gender, abilities, family structure, age, and
                  ethnicity are generally more effective at brainstorming because they bring together a lot of different lived
                  experiences.</p>
                <p>The brainstorm stage is also an ideal time to check out your product's competitors and identify if there are
                  already similar products available in the market. You want your product to fill a gap in the market or solve a
                  problem better than existing products. Completing research into both your competitors and your users helps
                  determine what problems need to be addressed by the product’s design.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Consider this example: If you’re designing a new app to help working parents and guardians, your team
                  might start the brainstorming stage by listing common problems that working parents and guardians face, like a
                  lack of reliable childcare, transportation concerns, or trouble managing schedules. Your team might review user
                  feedback about other similar products or the results of user surveys to help guide your ideas. After you’ve
                  brainstormed lots of user problems, your team chooses one and starts coming up with ideas for solutions to
                  that problem.</p>

                  the team determines concrete ways that the product being developed will impact the user. As a UX designer,
                  you'll begin to think more about specific details related to the product:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Who the product is for?</li>

                <hr>
                <p>During the define stage, your team narrows the focus of your idea. One product can’t solve every user problem.
                  In this stage, a UX designer might help the team pin down the focus of the idea, but a product lead will
                  probably be the one to define the scope of the project. The research you completed in the brainstorm stage comes
                  in handy now. Using what you've learned, you will pinpoint your potential users’ problems. Your team can’t
                  assume they know what problems users are experiencing without asking the users directly.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Continuing with the example for an app to help working parents and guardians, your idea should focus on

                <hr>
                <p>At this stage, UX designers develop the ideas for the product. Generally, UX designers start by drawing
                  wireframes, which are outlines or sketches of the product, then move on to creating prototypes, which are early
                  models of a product that convey its functionality. UX writers are also involved in the design stage and might do
                  things like write button labels or other copy within the product's wireframes and prototypes. At this point in
                  the life cycle, UX designers make sure to include all of the product specifications that were outlined in the
                  define stage. You might also check to ensure that each part of the design fits together in an intuitive way.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>For example, UX designers might check that the screens of an app flow in a way that makes sense to the user.
                  Or that each interaction, like tapping a button, has a correlating action, like an item getting added to a
                  cart. On the other hand, with a physical product, UX designers might check that one piece of a physical object
                  matches up to the connecting piece. UX designers also make sure that each task a user needs to complete is clear
                  and easy to understand, like navigating from the homepage to the checkout confirmation page in an app.</p>

                <p><b>Evaluating the product design based on the feedback of potential users.</b> Testing designs with users is
                  really important because it helps the team focus on the user first and foremost. Testing helps identify areas to
                  refine or improve the designs.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>UX designers work with engineers to develop functional prototypes that match the original designs, including
                  details and features that fit the company’s brand, like font and color choices. This also means writing the code
                  and finalizing the overall structure of the product. Or, if you want to test your designs earlier, another
                  option is to test a functioning prototype of the product, using a design tool like Figma or Adobe XD</p>
                <hr>
                <p>At this stage, the designs go through at least three phases of testing: internal tests within your company,
                  reviews with stakeholders, and external tests with potential users. A stakeholder is a person you need to work
                  with to complete the project or anyone who has some interest in the project, either within or outside of the
                  company.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>First, the team tests the product internally to look for technical glitches and usability problems. This is
                    often referred to as <b>alpha testing</b>.</li>
                  <li>Then, the product undergoes a test with stakeholders to make sure the product is aligned with the company’s
                    vision, meets legal guidelines for accessibility, and follows government regulations for privacy, for example.
                  </li>
                  <li>Finally, there’s an external test with potential users. This is the time to figure out whether the product
                    provides a good user experience, meaning it’s usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful. This is often referred
                    to as <b>beta testing</b>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Gathering and implementing feedback at this stage is absolutely critical. If users are frustrated or confused
                  by your product, UX designers make adjustments or even create new versions of the design. Then, the designs are
                  tested again, until there’s little or no friction between the product and the user. It’s important to call out
                  that the product development life cycle isn’t a completely linear process. Your team might cycle between

                <p><b>Sharing a finished version of the product with the public.</b> This might involve listing an app in the
                  Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store, making a website go live, or putting a physical product on store
                  shelves. However, the work on a product isn't quite finished after launch. You may still identify opportunities
                  to improve on the designs or learn even more about the UX based on feedback. This could involve going back to
                  the design or testing stages and figuring out ways to produce a more enhanced version of the product.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>The launch stage is a time to celebrate your work and start promoting the product. Marketing professionals on
                  your team might post about the new product on social media or publish a press release. The customer support team
                  might get ready to help new users learn how the product works. Program managers also meet with the
                  cross-functional team to reflect on the entsire product development life cycle and ask questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What worked and what could be improved?</li>
                  <li>Were goals achieved?</li>
                  <li>Were timelines met?</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <p>For a physical product, the launch stage might be the end of the product development life cycle. But for a
                  digital product, like an app or website, launching the product to a wider audience provides another opportunity
                  to improve on the user experience. New users might find problems with the product’s functionality or features to
                  improve that no one noticed before. So, after the launch stage, teams will often cycle back to the design and
                  testing stages to start working on the next version of a digital product.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Imagine you are evaluating the usability of an airline app. Assuming the primary purpose of this app is to
                    book a flight, the design should provide a clear and easy way to complete that task. For example, a section
                    where you can easily enter travel and flight details on the homepage would be an example of good usability.
                  </li>
                  <li>In grocery app, users can navigate to the cart icon in the header and easily check out from anywhere in the
                    app.</li>
                  <li>Ketchup came in a glass bottle. The user had to hit the bottom of the glass to make ketchup come out. Often,
                    no ketchup or too much ketchup would come out of the bottle. Today, the ketchup bottle has been redesigned
                    into a plastic squeezable bottle, which make it easier to use and allow users to control how much ketchup
                    comes out.</li>

                  <li>Dating app gives users the option to specify personal pronouns. This option ensures users can accurately
                    represent themselves.</li>
                  <li>One user might find an app with a lot of text easy to use. On the other hand, a user with a visual
                    impairment might want different features like sound.</li>

                <p><b>Equity</b> means providing people with the tools they need to accomplish their goals and support improved
                  quality of life. Equity goes beyond the concept of <b>equality</b>, where everyone is given equal resources,
                  because people often need different tools and support based on their needs. This is especially important to keep
                  in mind for those in commonly disenfranchised groups.</p>

                  <li>Workout app presents an encouraging message and graphic when the user is halfway to heir goal. This delights

                    features that can be used to transfer money between accounts and pay bills.</li>
                  <li>If you're lost, a map app telling you how to get home is useful. Maps app automatically marks paths with

                <hr>
                <p>It’s important to note that, while similar, useful and usable have different meanings. A product that is useful
                  isn’t always usable. The same is true for the opposite. The distinction between the two is that usability refers
                  to the product working well and being easy to use, while usefulness refers directly to the ability to solve user
                  problems.</p>
